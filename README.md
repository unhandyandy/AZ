This is a learning exercise for me to implement the AlphaZero algorithm in Julia using MCTS and Flux.  

The game I'm starting with is tic-tac-toe.  Of course ttt can be played perfectly using MCTS without 
any help from neural nets. So my goal is to train the net well enough that it recognize the best move 
without any help at all from MCTS.
